\noindent I would like to express my sincere thanks to all those people who made this report possible. First and foremost, I would like to express my profound respect and gratitude to my supervisors, Prof. Mahua Bhattacharaya and Dr. Roshni Chakraborty, who have been guiding force behind this work. I am greatly indebted for his invaluable guidance, constant encouragement, and his valuable comments on my work. I am fortunate enough to have such advisor who gave me the freedom to think independently and explore new ideas. More importantly, I would like to thank for the patience he has shown in carefully reading and commenting on the manuscripts, and countless revisions of this dissertation. His commitments and dedication to research have been and will continue to be a constant source of inspiration for me.
I am highly privileged to have got an opportunity to work with such wonderful person.
